# AI4ALL Summer Program University Partner Website Template

This version of the website uses only HTML and CSS. No additional installations
are required. You may and should freely modify this website template to fit your
program's needs.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Wells Santo
at wells@ai-4-all.org. If there are any typographical errors on the website, do
let me know as well.

## Things to Do

* Be sure that the color schemes for the website are correct for your university
and any branding requirements you may have to meet.
* Read through all 5 pages and update any program-specific language for your program (for example, program application dates, duration, staff, etc. on the Program Overview page; answers on the FAQ page; application information and dates on the Apply page; etc.)
* You may select your own program photos to use (the Google Drive link to folder with our existing
program photos is linked below) -- you can choose to use the photos I've selected as well.
* Update the "meta" tags at the top of each page
* Update footer social media links and contact links, if desired
