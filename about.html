        <h1>Program Overview</h1>

        <p>UCSF AI4ALL is a program promoting greater diversity and inclusion in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Our mission is to inspire tomorrowâ€™s leaders to know, think about, and use artificial intelligence ethically. During the program, participants receive broad exposure to Artificial Intelligence topics through faculty lectures and field trips, as well as an in-depth experience with a research area through hands-on projects. Mentoring and career/personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, and graduate students further enable personal growth and an opportunity to explore career interests at the intersection of Computer Science and Biomedicine. We are committed to serving students of all financial backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Who Should Apply?</h2>

        The program targets current <b>9th-11th graders</b> (rising 10-12th graders) from racial/ethnic groups dramatically underrepresented in AI: <b>Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Native American</b>. Applications from <b>young women</b> are particularly encouraged.

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>

        <p><b>Application Deadline: Monday, March 30, 2020</b></p>
        <p><b>UCSF AI4ALL 2020 Program: Monday, July 13 - Friday, July 31</b></p>

        <h2>Program Location</h2>

        The program will take place on the Mission Bay UCSF campus in San Francisco, California. Lectures and research will be conducted at the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute in Mission Bay. Students will be expected to commute to campus every day of the program; on-campus housing will not be provided.

        <!-- Program-specific projects can be listed here in place of the following paragraph as well -->

        <p>This is the first AI4ALL camp to focus on novel research discovery and the application of AI to Biomedicine. </p>

        <!-- Update with the typical daily schedule for your program -->
        <h1>Typical Daily Schedule</h1>

        <p>The weekly schedule consists of days split between lectures and demonstrations in the morning, and time to work on a hands-on research project in the afternoons.</p>

        <p>Days begin with breakfast and lectures from UCSF faculty and graduate students, followed by teaching and demostrations. During the presentations, participants engage with the day's lecturer and ask questions about their work and involvement in AI.</p>

        <p>After lunch, participants work on their research projects that will be presented at the end of the third week. Participants work closely with UCSF graduate students, who serve as research instructors, to apply the machine learning techniques they learn to real problems and datasets and to get hands-on experience with how using AI tools can be applied to biomedicine.</p>

        <p>Participants have time to interact with graduate students and postdocs to provide mentoring and help develop personal growth. They learn how to get involved in the AI community. There will be field trips, as well as panels hosted by our industry sponsors so students can learn about career opportunities in AI and how they can stay connected with the community.</p>

        <p>Below is a sample schedule:</p>
